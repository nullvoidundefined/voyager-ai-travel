/**
 * Returns the denominator the budget bar segment widths should divide
 * by. When the trip is within budget, divides by budget_total so unused
 * capacity renders as empty space. When allocated has crossed
 * budget_total (the over-budget case), divides by allocated so each
 * segment is normalized to its share and the bar always sums to 100%
 * instead of overflowing and being clipped by `overflow: hidden`.
 *
 * Returns 1 when budget_total is missing or non-positive so callers
 * can divide safely without producing Infinity or NaN.
