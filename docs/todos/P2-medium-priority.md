# P2: Medium Priority

All code-side P2 items shipped. Remaining work is either follow-up to user-action or extension of work already landed.

## Manual / user-action follow-ups

### Run cross-model judge validation

Infrastructure shipped: `eval/src/adversarial/cross-model-judge.ts` reruns the adversarial eval across Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4 20250514, and Opus 4.7 (override via `EVAL_JUDGE_MODELS`), prints the spread, and exits non-zero with a 'report as a range' message when spread > 0.05.

**Scope:** With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set and budget for ~3x normal adversarial eval cost, run `pnpm --filter voyager-eval eval:cross-model-judge`. Record the spread. If spread > 0.05, update the README's published pass-rate to a range. If <= 0.05, the lock-in concern is retracted; note that in the audit follow-up file.

## E2E follow-ups (B24 continuation)

The MockAnthropic infrastructure now supports persistent server-side selections via the `selectFlight` scenario (commit `0bc5b4a`). Two more scenarios are needed to fully restore the deleted E2E specs:

### US-19: travel_plan_form scenario

The agent should emit `update_trip` tool_use when the form payload arrives, then `format_response` to acknowledge. Add a `formFill` scenario keyed on the form-derived "I want to go to X, ..." message shape.

### US-36: plan_card scenario

The agent should emit a `format_response` containing a `plan_card` node on the first turn after trip details are collected, then wait for `planConfirmation` to advance. Add a `planCard` scenario that detects the absence of `plan_confirmed` in the booking_state and emits the plan card; once confirmed, advances to the search step.

Once these two scenarios exist, restore US-19, US-23, and US-36 in `e2e/chat-booking-flow.spec.ts` and remove the `void tripUrl;` guard in `e2e/real/happy-path-real.spec.ts:169`.
