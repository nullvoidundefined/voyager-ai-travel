## Plan Card Flow (PLAN_TRIP Phase)

### US-36: Confirm a trip plan card before the agent starts searching

**As a** user starting a new trip
**I want to** confirm what the agent will search for (flights, hotels, experiences, car rental) and tweak the experience-interest categories
**So that** I can shape the agent's plan before it spends API budget on searches I do not want

**Acceptance criteria:**

- After the trip-details form is submitted, the agent emits a `plan_card` node before any `search_*` tool is called.
- The TripPlanWidget renders the plan card with toggles per category (flights, hotels, experiences, car rental).
- For the experiences category, a multi-select sub-option ("interests") with the canonical EXPERIENCE_INTEREST_OPTIONS values is shown.
- Toggling a category off marks it as `not_applicable` in the booking state and the agent skips that sub-agent for the rest of the trip.
- Clicking "Start planning" confirms the plan: a `planConfirmation` payload is POSTed to `/trips/{id}/chat` and the booking state's `plan_confirmed` flag is set to `true`.
- The plan card is hidden in subsequent turns once confirmed; the agent moves into the first enabled category's sub-agent flow.
- The `planConfirmation` payload is validated server-side against `planCardSchema` (max 10 categories, max 3 sub_options per category, max 20 values per sub_option, max 100 chars per value string) and rejected with 400 on any violation.

**Sources:** TripPlanWidget component, `applyPlanConfirmation` in `chat.helpers.ts`, `plan.prompt.ts`, `planCardSchema` (SEC-04).

**Test coverage:** Plan-card rendering invariants live in `ChatBox.invariants.test.tsx` (TripPlanWidget render assertion). Server-side acceptance lives in `chat.helpers.test.ts` (applyPlanConfirmation) and `planCard.test.ts` (schema bounds). An end-to-end test of the full submit-form -> plan-card -> confirm -> first-search loop is blocked on the MockAnthropic state machine (ENG-17 / B24); restore alongside US-19 and US-23 when that lands.
