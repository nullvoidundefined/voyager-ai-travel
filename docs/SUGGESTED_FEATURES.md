## Trip Planning & Search

### 1. Multi-City / Multi-Stop Itineraries

**Seen in:** Google Flights, Kayak, TripIt, Wanderlog
Route optimization across multiple destinations (Paris → Barcelona → Rome) with inter-city transport suggestions. The agent would need to plan legs sequentially, optimizing total travel time and cost across the full route.

### 2. Flexible Date Search

**Seen in:** Google Flights, Skyscanner, Hopper
Show a price calendar for +/- 3 days around the requested dates. The agent could call `search_flights` multiple times with nearby dates and present the cheapest combination.

### 3. "Inspire Me" / Destination Discovery

**Seen in:** Skyscanner Explore, Google Flights Explore, Kiwi Nomad
Users provide budget and dates but no destination. The agent searches multiple destinations within budget and recommends the best value. Requires a curated list of candidate cities.

### 4. Layover & Stopover Experiences

**Seen in:** Kiwi.com, IcelandAir Stopover, Singapore Airlines
When a flight has a long layover (4+ hours), suggest things to do near the connecting airport. The agent could detect layovers in flight results and call `search_experiences` for the layover city.

### 5. Alternative Airport Suggestions

**Seen in:** Google Flights, Kayak, Momondo
Search nearby airports (e.g., OAK/SJC instead of SFO) for cheaper flights. The `get_destination_info` tool could return nearby IATA codes, and the agent could compare prices across them.

### 6. Round-Trip vs. Open-Jaw Optimization

**Seen in:** Google Flights, Kayak
Detect when flying into one city and out of another is cheaper than a round-trip to one city. Useful for multi-city trips.

### 7. Accommodation Type Variety

**Seen in:** Airbnb, Booking.com, Hostelworld
Search vacation rentals, hostels, and boutique hotels in addition to standard hotels. Could integrate an Airbnb/VRBO API or scrape listings through SerpApi.

## Budget & Financial

Break the total budget into a per-day allocation with categories (lodging, food, transport, activities). The agent could generate a day-by-day spending plan.

### 9. Currency Conversion in Context

Display prices in both the local currency and the user's home currency. Store user's home currency in preferences and convert all displayed prices.

### 10. Price Prediction & Alerts

**Seen in:** Hopper, Google Flights, Kayak Price Alerts
Predict whether flight/hotel prices will go up or down. Alert users when prices drop for saved trips. Would require a background worker polling prices on a schedule.

### 11. Tipping & Hidden Cost Estimates

Add estimates for tips, resort fees, tourist taxes, and visa costs that travelers often forget. The agent could include these in the budget breakdown based on destination customs.

### 12. Group Cost Splitting

**Seen in:** Splitwise, Tricount, TripIt for Teams

## Itinerary & Schedule

### 13. Day-by-Day Itinerary Builder

**Seen in:** Wanderlog, TripIt, Sygic Travel

After booking, track flight delays, gate changes, and cancellations. Could integrate FlightAware API or AviationStack for live status.

### 16. Restaurant Reservations

### 17. Transit & Ground Transportation

---

Generate a shareable link to the itinerary. Recipients can view (but not edit) the plan. Requires a public trip view with no auth required.

### 20. Collaborative Editing

### 21. Voting on Options

**Seen in:** Wanderlog, Doodle, When2Meet
Group members vote on flight times, hotels, or activities. The most-voted option gets selected. Could use a simple polling mechanism per trip item.

## AI & Intelligence

Ingest travel guides, blog posts, and local tips into a vector database. When the agent discusses a destination, it retrieves relevant context (best neighborhoods, seasonal events, safety tips). Reuses the RAG pattern from App 4.

### 26. Natural Language Booking Modifications

**Seen in:** Lola (defunct), Mezi (defunct), Kayak chatbot
"Move my flight to the afternoon" or "switch to a hotel closer to the beach" — the agent interprets the modification, re-searches with updated constraints, and presents alternatives. (Partially implemented already via multi-turn iteration.)

### 27. Proactive Suggestions

**Seen in:** Google Travel, TripIt Pro
The agent notices patterns and suggests things unprompted: "Your flight arrives at 11 PM — you might want a hotel near the airport for the first night" or "Barcelona has a major festival during your dates, expect higher hotel prices."

### 28. Sentiment-Aware Responses

**Seen in:** Replika, Character.AI, advanced chatbots
Detect user frustration (e.g., "everything is too expensive") and adjust tone and strategy — offer budget tips, suggest off-season dates, or find deals.

### 29. Multi-Language Support

**Seen in:** Google Translate, DeepL, most travel apps
Support trip planning in the user's preferred language. Claude handles multilingual input natively; the frontend would need i18n for static UI text.

### 30. Voice Input
