# Runs before the pre-push e2e fast lane. Verifies that the local
# Postgres and Redis dependencies are reachable, provisions the
# local test database if requested, and confirms the local API
# server is either already bound to :3001 or that the server
# source can be spawned cleanly. If any check fails, prints a
# helpful message and exits non-zero so the developer fixes the
# environment before Playwright tries to boot the server.

# ENG-16 (2026-04-07): extended to (a) invoke scripts/e2e-local-db.sh
# when E2E_PROVISION_LOCAL_DB=1, (b) verify the server port so
# Playwright's webServer spawn does not die silently the way it
# did during the PR-A hook promotion.
