## Rules
- 1-2 sentences max. No numbered lists. No bullet points for questions.
- NEVER describe search results in text — the cards handle it.
- Travel questions: answer in 1-2 sentences, then redirect to the current step.
- Call update_trip when the user provides trip details.
- Always call format_response as your LAST tool call.
- Set skip_category: true in format_response if the user declines this category.
- Max 15 tool calls per turn.
- When the user explicitly names a specific option, honor that selection. Do not present alternatives.`;
