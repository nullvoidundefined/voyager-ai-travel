## 2026-04-06 audit run (P2 and P3 findings)

### Engineering (tech debt)

### [ENG-21] Pre-existing em dashes in `CLAUDE.md` violate the global em-dash rule (RESOLVED, was already fixed when ENG-21 was logged)

- **Source:** 2026-04-07 critic-guided meta-rule edit session audit
- **Severity:** P3 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** docs / style
- **Status:** RESOLVED 2026-04-07. ENG-21 was based on stale information. Verified during the 2026-04-07 ENG-20/21 cleanup pass that `CLAUDE.md` actually contained 0 em dash characters (U+2014) at every commit from `5380f99` onwards (the `docs(CLAUDE.md): absorb Voyager incident history from global rules` commit). The 8 em dashes referenced in the original ENG-21 note were present at `27e41de` and `c2a3bc2` but had already been removed by the time the ENG-21 ticket was logged at `22dda36`. The original ticket text apparently transposed line numbers from an earlier inspection of an older revision. Verification command: `python3 -c "import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['git','show','22dda36:CLAUDE.md']).decode().count(chr(0x2014)))"` returns `0`. No edit was needed; the bookkeeping is the only change.
- **Original notes (preserved for context):** `CLAUDE.md` on main as of commit `22dda36` was claimed to contain eight em-dash characters (U+2014) on lines 29, 33, 34, 45, 63, 66, 82, and 87. The global em-dash ban in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` covers all markdown files including project CLAUDE.md files and was intentionally elevated to global scope to prevent exactly this drift.

### [ENG-20] 13 orphaned git worktrees in `.claude/worktrees/` (RESOLVED 2026-04-07)

- **Source:** 2026-04-07 lint deadlock investigation (see commits `1dd2bd0` chore(eslint) and `498a720` chore(lefthook))
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** tech-debt / tooling
- **Status:** RESOLVED 2026-04-07. All 13 worktrees removed and their branches deleted on `chore/eng-20-21-cleanup-2026-04-07`. Triage process: each branch was compared to main via `git diff main..<branch> --stat` and content was verified to already be on main, either via direct merge or via a re-committed equivalent. The 4 already-merged branches (feat/e2e-mock-anthropic-2026-04-06, plan/audit-2026-04-06, plan/e2e-and-gates-2026-04-06, fix/audit-2026-04-06-p0p1) were ancestors of main and removed cleanly. The 8 audit branches each contained one audit report file that already existed on main, with the only differences being prettier formatting cleanups (em-dash replacement, table alignment, unescaped underscores) that happened during the landing pass. The 1 docs/billing-anthropic-configured-2026-04-07 branch contained the same change as commit `a42bbac` already on main via PR #21. No content was lost. A bonus orphan branch `worktree-agent-aebc5a93` (created automatically alongside `audit/legal-2026-04-06` when the worktree was provisioned) was also removed in the same pass.
- **Why it mattered:** one of these worktrees (`agent-a23ae2b5`) directly caused a commit deadlock on 2026-04-07. ESLint's flat config did not exclude `.claude/**`, so it walked into every worktree, and the worktree files are not covered by any tsconfig project in the main checkout's `parserOptions.project`, so `@typescript-eslint/parser` emitted 2945 spurious "parserOptions.project has been provided" errors on an untouched checkout. The proximate fix was `.claude/**` added to the eslint ignores list in commit `1dd2bd0`. With the worktrees themselves now removed, the latent trap is gone too.
- **Original worktree inventory** (preserved for incident traceability):
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-a23ae2b5` on `worktree-agent-a23ae2b5` (caused the 2026-04-07 deadlock). REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-a3d8f473` on `worktree-agent-a3d8f473`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-a4fffa10` on `worktree-agent-a4fffa10`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-a85513f0` on `worktree-agent-a85513f0`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-a9c2d56e` on `worktree-agent-a9c2d56e`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-ab3c1e9a` on `worktree-agent-ab3c1e9a`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-aca1fb11` on `worktree-agent-aca1fb11`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/agent-aebc5a93` on `audit/legal-2026-04-06`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/e2e-mock-anthropic-2026-04-06` on `feat/e2e-mock-anthropic-2026-04-06`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/plan-audit-2026-04-06` on `plan/audit-2026-04-06`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/plan-b-e2e-2026-04-06` on `plan/e2e-and-gates-2026-04-06`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/plan-c-fixes-2026-04-06` on `fix/audit-2026-04-06-p0p1`. REMOVED
  - `.claude/worktrees/queue-cleanup-2026-04-06` on `test/eng-19-coverage-85-2026-04-07`. REMOVED
- **Follow-up surfaced during the cleanup:** the main checkout still has additional stale local branches that were never tied to a worktree but are also old audit-era artifacts: `backup/pre-reset-2026-04-07`, `chore/dead-test-cleanup-2026-04-06`, `chore/queue-cleanup-2026-04-06`, `feat/chatbox-invariants-test-2026-04-06`, `feat/eng-17-multi-turn-mock-2026-04-06`, `feat/eng-17-trip-with-selections-2026-04-06`, `feat/unblock-fixme-markers-2026-04-06`, `fix/eng-16-fast-lane-parity-2026-04-06`, `fix/eng-16-local-db-fixture-2026-04-07`, `fix/routes-test-rate-limiter-mock-2026-04-06`, `test/eng-18-coverage-restore-2026-04-07`, `test/eng-19-coverage-85-2026-04-07`. These are out of scope for ENG-20 (not worktrees) but should be triaged in a separate cleanup pass. Logged below as ENG-22.

### [ENG-22] Stale local branches without worktrees from 2026-04-06 era (RESOLVED 2026-04-07)

- **Source:** surfaced during ENG-20 cleanup on 2026-04-07
- **Severity:** P3 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** tech-debt / tooling
- **Status:** RESOLVED 2026-04-07. All 12 branches deleted on `chore/eng-22-cleanup-2026-04-07`. Triage: 11 of the 12 were already-merged ancestors of main (pure leftover labels). The remaining branch `backup/pre-reset-2026-04-07` had 5 unique commits (`e36e6a2`, `36bd653`, `03b8782`, `94aeff9`, `63298f6`) representing the original drafts of the eslint-ignore-claude, lefthook-staged-files, ENG-20-ticket, CLAUDE.md-incident-history, and 4-doc-prettier-cleanup work. None of these SHAs exist on main, but the resulting content does (verified via `grep -c '\.claude' eslint.config.bottomlessmargaritas.js` returns 1, `grep -c 'staged_files' lefthook.yml` returns 2, `grep -c 'ENG-20' ISSUES.md` returns 5, `grep -c 'Incident history' CLAUDE.md` returns 1). The branch represents the pre-rebase / pre-squash form of work that has since landed on main via PRs with different SHAs. No content was lost. All 12 branches removed via `git branch -D`.
- **Branches removed (preserved for traceability):**
  - `backup/pre-reset-2026-04-07` (5 ahead, content on main via different SHAs)
  - `chore/dead-test-cleanup-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `chore/queue-cleanup-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `feat/chatbox-invariants-test-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `feat/eng-17-multi-turn-mock-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `feat/eng-17-trip-with-selections-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `feat/unblock-fixme-markers-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `fix/eng-16-fast-lane-parity-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `fix/eng-16-local-db-fixture-2026-04-07` (ancestor of main)
  - `fix/routes-test-rate-limiter-mock-2026-04-06` (ancestor of main)
  - `test/eng-18-coverage-restore-2026-04-07` (ancestor of main)
  - `test/eng-19-coverage-85-2026-04-07` (ancestor of main)

### [ENG-05] No Sentry / error tracking integrated

- **Source:** engineering §Operational Basics
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** observability
- **Notes:** logs-plus-post-deploy-check partially mitigates. Adding Sentry to both server and web-client is a significant observability win for an agentic product that has many failure modes.

### [ENG-06] No `pnpm audit` in CI, no Dependabot / Renovate

- **Source:** engineering §Dependencies
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** L · **Category:** security / tech-debt
- **Notes:** A repo with ~40 dependencies and no automated dependency updates will drift into CVEs within 6-12 months. Add `pnpm audit --prod` to CI and wire up Dependabot via `.github/dependabot.yml`.

### [ENG-07] Chat endpoint has no integration test

- **Source:** engineering §Testing
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** testing
- **Notes:** SSE flow, auth, rate limit, 409 conflict under lock. The critical-path endpoint has only unit tests.

### [ENG-08] Dockerfile runs as root

- **Source:** engineering §Deployment, security §Infrastructure
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** Use `USER node` (already present in `node:22-slim`). Quick hardening win.

### [ENG-09] Smoke test script not wired to CI

- **Source:** engineering §Operational Basics
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** testing
- **Notes:** `scripts/smoke-test.sh` is referenced from `package.json` but may not exist. Verify and wire into CI.

### [ENG-19] Push server vitest coverage threshold from 80% to 85%

- **Source:** PR-J follow-up (2026-04-07). PR-J restored the threshold to 80 after ENG-18; the ENG-18 notes listed remaining files below 70-80% branches and tagged them as ENG-19 for follow-up.
- **Severity:** P3 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** testing / quality
- **Status:** RESOLVED in PR-K (2026-04-07). Wrote 45 additional tests targeting every file in the ENG-18 remaining-gap list:
  - **`src/handlers/chat/chat.helpers.ts`** 76.92% -> 100% branches (13 new tests covering `buildMissingFieldsForm` (empty destination, departure_date, return_date, budget, travelers null, travelers < 1, multiple missing, one_way trip), `buildTripContext` edge cases (null optionals, null prices, null selection fields, total_spent sum)).
  - **`src/tools/flights.tool.ts`** 60% -> ~90% branches (2 new tests: SerpApi quota exceeded graceful degrade to empty array, isMockMode returning true).
  - **`src/tools/hotels.tool.ts`** 59% -> ~90% branches (3 new tests: quota exceeded, rethrow of non-quota errors, isMockMode).
  - **`src/tools/executor.ts`** 68% -> ~100% branches (9 new tests covering select_hotel, select_car_rental, select_experience happy paths, their missing-context error branches, and their missing-required-field rejections).
  - **`src/services/node-builder.ts`** 74% -> ~100% branches (6 new tests for object-shape tool results, empty extract, missing hotel prices, lat/lon vs latitude/longitude, missing car rental features, empty calculate_remaining_budget).
  - **`src/middleware/requestLogger/requestLogger.ts`** 50% -> ~90% branches (2 new tests for array-form request-id and response serializer).
  - **`src/services/agent.service.ts`** 45% -> ~80% branches (4 new tests for advisory node assembly, quick_replies node assembly, empty quick_replies skip, and budget_bar ordering after text).
  - **`src/handlers/trips/trips.ts`** 75% -> ~95% branches (5 new tests for past departure date rejection, reversed dates, destination-change-with-selections clear path, destination-unchanged skip, destination-change-without-selections skip).
  - **Global coverage**: lines 90.71%, branches 85.22%, functions 85.93%, statements 90.71%. Threshold raised from 80 to 85 with safety margin in all four metrics.
  - **Server test count**: 620 passing (was 572 after ENG-18).

  **Remaining gaps** (P3, leave as future work):
  - `src/app.ts` 0% (best covered by an integration test)
  - `src/services/enrichment-sources/*` (fcdo, open-meteo, state-dept) at 8-66% (external API wrappers; need mocked HTTP)
  - `src/utils/ApiError.ts` functions at 44% (helpers for specific error types that are not hit in the current paths)
  - `src/handlers/trips/conversations.ts` 75% branches (some branches need mocked DB)

### [ENG-18] Restore server vitest coverage threshold to 80% by writing the missing tests

- **Source:** PR-G follow-up (2026-04-06). PR-G lowered the server vitest coverage threshold from 80% to 75% so the lint-and-test workflow could go green after PR-C correctly removed `**/rateLimiter.ts` from the coverage exclusion.
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** L · **Category:** testing / quality
- **Status:** RESOLVED in PR-J (2026-04-07). Wrote 47 new tests across three of the lowest-coverage files:
  - **`src/prompts/trip-context.ts`** 10% -> ~95% branches (35 new tests covering every conditional branch in `formatTripContext` and `formatChecklist`, including the safety context injections for LGBTQ+ / woman / non-binary / solo travelers).
  - **`src/utils/logs/logger.ts`** 0% -> 100% (4 new tests covering the NODE_ENV branch that swaps pino-pretty in dev vs prod).
  - **`src/routes/trips.ts`** + **`src/routes/places.ts`** 0% -> 100% wiring coverage (8 new route-wiring smoke tests in `routes.trips-places.test.ts` following the same pattern as the existing `routes.test.ts`).
  - **Global coverage**: lines 89.19%, branches 80.38%, functions 85.86%, statements 89.19%. Threshold restored from 75 to 80 with safety margin in all four metrics.
  - **Server test count**: 572 passing (was 525 at the start of this session).

  **Remaining gaps still worth closing** (tracked as ENG-19 for anyone who wants to push further toward 85):
  - `src/app.ts` 0% (the Express app composition, best covered by an integration test that boots the server)
  - `src/services/agent.service.ts` 45.83% (the LLM consumer surface; the ENG-15 retrospective recommended fixture-replay tests here)
  - `src/tools/flights.tool.ts` 60%, `src/tools/hotels.tool.ts` 59.25%, `src/tools/executor.ts` 68.96% (each has happy-path coverage but missing error branches)
  - `src/handlers/chat/chat.helpers.ts` 65.67%, `src/handlers/trips/trips.ts` 67.64%

  Related: ENG-15 (test suite evaluation) recommends fixture-replay tests for the LLM consumer surface. Those tests would also push branch coverage on agent.service.ts.

### [ENG-17] Trip-with-selections fixture for the last 3 test.fixme markers

- **Source:** PR-E follow-up (2026-04-06). Renamed from "multi-turn MockAnthropic state machine" after PR-E discovered the original analysis was wrong.
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** testing / e2e
- **Status:** RESOLVED in PR-H (2026-04-07). Added a gated test-only endpoint `POST /trips/:id/test-selections` in `server/src/handlers/trips/trips.ts` that directly calls the existing `insertTripFlight` / `insertTripHotel` / `insertTripCarRental` / `insertTripExperience` repo functions. The endpoint returns 404 unless `E2E_BYPASS_RATE_LIMITS=1` is set, so it is invisible in production. Built `seedTripSelections(page, tripId, selections)` and `defaultSelections()` helpers in `e2e/fixtures/test-trips.ts`. Converted the three remaining `test.fixme` markers (US-23, US-26, US-27) to real tests. **Fixme count on main: 0 of original 10.** All US-1 through US-35 are now active tests. 4 new server handler tests cover the new endpoint with the full gate matrix (flag unset, ownership mismatch, payload with all selection types, empty payload).

### [ENG-16] Local e2e-fast fast lane needs CI parity before it can be promoted to blocking

- **Source:** PR-A queue cleanup (2026-04-06). Promoted to blocking too eagerly; reverted; partially fixed in PR-F; fully fixed in PR-I.
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** testing / DX
- **Status:** RESOLVED in PR-I (2026-04-07).
  - New `scripts/e2e-local-db.sh` provisions a local Postgres test database (idempotent), runs migrations, and emits a `DATABASE_URL` export statement. Invoked opt-in via `E2E_PROVISION_LOCAL_DB=1` on the first run, then skipped on subsequent runs because the DB already exists.
  - `scripts/e2e-precheck.sh` extended to run the DB provisioner when asked and to report the process holding port 3001 (if any) so Playwright's webServer spawn failure mode no longer silently collides with a stale dev server.
  - `playwright.config.ts` now prefers `DATABASE_URL_E2E_LOCAL` over the inherited `DATABASE_URL` when set. Developers can point the fast lane at the local test DB without touching `server/.env`.
  - Together: local fast lane stays fast (single-digit-ms DB latency), the spawn failure mode is visible, and the `e2e-fast` hook is suitable for blocking mode on dev machines that have run the one-time `E2E_PROVISION_LOCAL_DB=1 ./scripts/e2e-precheck.sh`.
  - The hook is NOT re-promoted to blocking in this PR because that requires user opt-in (the one-time provisioning step). The lefthook comment now points developers at the provisioning command; once they run it, they can flip the hook to blocking in their own workflow.

### [ENG-15] Evaluate test suite for bloat, thinness, AND confidence theater

- **Source:** Plan B / option B follow-up (2026-04-06), reinforced by the Doppelscript Haiku code-fence incident the same day
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** testing / quality
- **Notes:** Run a research subagent (after option B merges so the CI baseline is green) that produces `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-test-suite-evaluation.md`. Goal: smallest set of tests that catches the bugs that matter, with zero confidence theater. Three failure modes to evaluate: bloat (redundant), thinness (gaps), confidence theater (passing tests that wouldn't catch real bugs).

  **Bloat signals:** redundant assertions, coverage delta of zero when a test is removed, test:source LoC ratio outliers, runtime per assertion, tests that have never failed in CI history.

  **Thinness signals:** files with no tests, branch coverage gaps, fix commits without paired tests (cross-ref the fix-commit-gate violations from the 2026-04-06 retrospective: 35 of 51 fix commits violate test-first), user stories without real E2E coverage (the 10 current test.fixme markers are hidden gaps).

  **Confidence theater signals (per the no-confidence-theater rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`):**
  1. Self-mock: `vi.mock('./foo')` inside `foo.test.ts`
  2. Mocked dependency that IS the thing being tested (parser tested with pre-parsed input)
  3. Mock-call assertions without behavior assertions (`toHaveBeenCalled` only)
  4. Snapshot-only tests with no behavioral assertion
  5. Mocking the integration boundary the test claims to cross (repository tests that mock the db pool)
  6. Tautological assertions (assertion guaranteed by setup)
  7. Loose-shape only assertions (`toBeDefined`, `toBeTruthy`, "no throw")
  8. Skipped tests with no comment or triage reference
  9. Always-failing tests that linger
  10. LLM-consumer tests that hand-mock the model response shape instead of using a real captured fixture (the Doppelscript anchor incident: a Haiku markdown code-fence bug shipped because tests mocked the JSON the parser was supposed to consume; only a live calibration run caught it)

  Deliverable sections: per-package inventory (server, web-client, e2e), top 10 bloat candidates, top 10 thinness gaps, top 10 confidence theater violations with file:line evidence, top 10 untested files with addition candidates, never-failed-in-CI list, coverage map by user story / audit ID / fix commit, concrete add/delete/rewrite recommendations.

  **Deletion threshold:** redundant AND source is stable AND removing it does not drop branch coverage. Three signals before touching anything.

  **Confidence-theater rewrite threshold:** any test that fails the "if I delete the implementation and throw, would this test fail?" check must be rewritten to assert behavior, not interactions. LLM-consumer tests must use a real captured fixture, not a hand-mock.

### [ENG-14] E2E config has no fail-fast smoke check; misconfigurations burn CI time

- **Source:** Plan B / option B follow-up (2026-04-06 incident)
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** testing / CI / DX
- **Notes:** A 15-minute CI run failed because `CORS_ORIGIN` defaulted to the legacy `http://localhost:5173` (Vite) while Next.js dev runs on `:3000`. Every browser request from the test runner returned `net::ERR_FAILED` and Playwright dutifully retried each of 35 specs three times before reporting failure. The actual problem was a single env var. The lesson: any precondition that, if wrong, would invalidate every test, must be checked BEFORE Playwright spins up. Concrete fix: add a `scripts/e2e-smoke.sh` (or extend `e2e-precheck.sh`) that runs after the webServer is up and BEFORE the test step, hitting `GET /health` and `OPTIONS /auth/login` from `Origin: http://localhost:3000`, and exits non-zero with a clear message if either the server is down OR CORS is misconfigured. Wire it as a workflow step between `playwright install` and `pnpm test:e2e`. Same principle for any future "every test depends on X being true" precondition: assert it explicitly, fail fast, do not let Playwright discover it via 35 consecutive timeouts. Related class: any "legacy default" in a config file (Vite port, old project name, deprecated env var name) is a landmine; add a startup-time validation that flags suspicious defaults when `NODE_ENV=test` or `CI=true`.

### [ENG-13] E2E suite runtime is slower than it should be

- **Source:** Plan B / option B follow-up (2026-04-06)
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** testing / CI
- **Notes:** Voyager has ~42 Playwright tests with all externals mocked (SerpApi, Google Places, Anthropic via `MockAnthropicClient`). A healthy run at this size and config should land around 6 to 8 minutes; observed CI runs are sitting at 11+ minutes. Two concrete fixes: (1) bump `workers` from 1 to 2 or 4 in `playwright.config.ts` with per-worker test database isolation so the seedUser fixture does not collide. About 2x speedup. (2) Investigate retry frequency. With `retries: 2` a single flaky spec costs 3x its base time. If 10 percent of specs retry, that adds roughly 30 percent wall time. Goal: zero retries on a green run. Once the suite is below 5 minutes the `e2e-fast` lefthook hook can be promoted from warning to blocking.

### [ENG-10] Partial tool-call progress visibility lost at 15-call limit

- **Source:** engineering §AgentOrchestrator
- **Severity:** P3 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** observability
- **Notes:** When the tool-call limit is hit mid-batch, the `toolCallsUsed` and `nodes` arrays lose partial progress visibility. Preserve them in the orchestrator result.

### [ENG-11] No rollback runbook in `docs/`

- **Source:** engineering §Operational Basics
- **Severity:** P3 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** documentation
- **Notes:** Railway has built-in rollback but the procedure is not written down.

### [ENG-12] Package names still say `agentic-travel-agent*` after rename to Voyager

- **Source:** engineering §Naming drift
- **Severity:** P3 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** branding / tech-debt
- **Notes:** Rename the server, web, and shared-types packages to `voyager-*` as one atomic refactor.
- **Status: closed** by the mechanical rename across 39 files plus lockfile regeneration on the `fix/audit-2026-04-06-p0p1` branch. The Vercel project slug and the `interviewiangreenough.xyz` deploy URL still reference the old name in `CLAUDE.md`; those are infra-level identifiers external to the codebase and are tracked as a separate infra cleanup.

### Security (hardening)

### [SEC-05] Postgres RLS policies missing

- **Source:** security §Authorization
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** L · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** CLAUDE.md promises RLS but none is configured. Add RLS policies on all user-owned tables (trips, conversations, user_preferences).

### [SEC-06] CSRF uses header-presence check, not synchronizer-token pair

- **Source:** security §CSRF
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** Upgrade to a synchronizer-token cookie pair for stronger CSRF protection.

### [SEC-07] `err.message` returned in non-production can leak SerpApi error bodies

- **Source:** security §Secrets Management
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** `errorHandler` returns `err.message` when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. Log full, respond scrubbed always.

### [SEC-08] Auth rate limiter is single (login + register + reset)

- **Source:** security §API Security
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** Separate into `loginLimiter` and `registerLimiter` with different budgets.

### [SEC-09] `activeConversations` exposed in `/health/ready` payload

- **Source:** security §API Security
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** Don't leak active user IDs in a public health endpoint.

### [SEC-10] Password complexity weak

- **Source:** security §P2
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** Reject top-1000 breached passwords. Require >=12 chars OR mixed classes.

### [SEC-11] Per-account failed-login backoff not enforced

- **Source:** security §P2
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** M · **Category:** security
- **Notes:** After N failed logins for the same account, introduce exponential backoff independent of IP rate limiting.

### [SEC-12] `requestLogger` may log `req.body`

- **Source:** security §Data Protection
- **Severity:** P2 · **Effort:** S · **Category:** privacy
- **Notes:** Verify the request logger does not record `req.body` at any log level.

### [SEC-13] `deleteExpiredSessions` not scheduled

- **Source:** security §Data Protection
